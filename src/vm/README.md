# A Brief Introduction to MiniVM

MiniVM is a virtual machine for interpreting Eeyore/Tigger IR, so its design is deeply influenced by Eeyore and Tigger.

The current version of MiniVM is implemented in C++ language, but in fact, there are no restrictions on the host language that implements MiniVM.

## Architecture of Virtual Machine

MiniVM is a stack-based virtual machine, which means most of the operands required by instructions come from the internal stack of the virtual machine. In details, MiniVM has the following built-in structures:

* **Operand stack**: storing operands or parameters.
* **Environment stack**: holding environments and return addresses for each active functions.
* **Memory pool**: holding all dynamically allocated memory.
* **Static registers**: storing some static data, designed to execute Tigger IR.
* **Symbol pool**: holding all symbols, which can be variable names or external function names.
* **Instruction container**: holding all instructions and debugging information.
* **Program counter**: holding a pointer to the instruction currently being executed.
* **External function table**: holding all definitions of external functions.

Considering that static registers are closely related to the target architecture supported by Tigger, although the current Tigger IR only supports the RISC-V architecture, it may support more architectures in the future. Therefore, the count of the static registers should not be fixed.

The external function table can be modified before MiniVM starts. Developers can register any host language function to the table, and assign a symbol to it, in order to provide library functions such as `putint` for programs running in MiniVM.

## Instruction Definition

MiniVM can not directly execute Eeyore or Tigger, so there should be a front end to read Eeyore/Tigger source files, and generate instructions that can be recognized by MiniVM. The instruction set of MiniVM is called Gopher (in order to match with Eeyore and Tigger).

The structure of Gopher instruction is defined as follows:

```
0   7 8       31
+----+---------+
| op |   opr   |
+----+---------+
```

As we can see, it consists of two field `op` and `opr`, the former is the opcode of instruction, and the latter is the operand, which can be:

* `sym`: symbol reference, which represents a symbol in the symbol pool.
* `imm`: 24-bit sign-extended immediate.
* `pc`: absolute target address, used in control transfer instructions.
* `reg`: id of static register.

MiniVM supports the following instructions:

* **Memory allocation**: Var, Arr.
* **Load and store**: Ld, LdVar, LdReg, LdAddr, St, StVar, StVarP, StReg, StRegP, Imm, ImmHi.
* **Control transfer**: Bnz, Jmp.
* **Function call**: Call, CallExt, Ret, Param.
* **Debugging**: Break.
* **Logical operations**: LNot, LAnd, LOr.
* **Comparisons**: Eq, Ne, Gt, Lt, Ge, Le.
* **Arithmetic operations**: Neg, Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Mod.

## Calling Conventions

When executing a `Call`/`CallExt` instruction, MiniVM will:

1. Create a new environment, and push it to the environment stack.
2. Check the operand stack, if there are any values in it, pop them and add them to the environment, then assign symbol to it, such as `p0`, `p1`, etc.
3. Jump to target pc address, or call the specific external function.

On the contrast, when executing a `Ret` instruction, MiniVM will:

* If the size of the environment stack is 1, it means that instructions are currently being executed in the global environment, just stop the execution.
* Otherwise, pop an environment from the top of the stack and release it, and then jump to the return address.

So what about the details of external functions? We make the following conventions:

### Form of External Functions

MiniVM can accept external functions in the following form:

```
func externalFunc(vm_instance: MiniVM): Boolean
```

Therefore, external functions can access the current environment and all static registers in MiniVM.

If any error occurs during the external function call, the function should return `False`, otherwise it should return `True`.

### Passing Parameters

To be compatible with Eeyore and Tigger, MiniVM supports two methods for passing parameters:

1. Store parameter #1, parameter #2... to function's environment with the symbol `p1`, `p2`..., or
2. Store parameters to the specific static registers or an data block with symbol `$frame` in memory pool, depends on the target architecture of Tigger.

MiniVM ***must ensure***:

* Before the `Call`/`CallExt` instructions are executed, there is no value in the operand stack, except for function parameters.
* When executing Eeyore generated instructions, there are no data blocks with symbol `$frame` in the current environment.
* When executing Tigger generated instructions, there must be a data blocks with symbol `$frame` in all of the local environment, and, all `$frame`s should be placed consecutively in the same area of the memory pool.

Considering the impact on performance, we strongly recommend that developers should create two versions of external functions for MiniVM running in Eeyore mode and Tigger mode.

### Passing Return Values

To be compatible with Eeyore and Tigger, MiniVM supports two methods for passing return values:

1. Push return value to operand stack, or
2. Store return value to the specific static register, depends on the target architecture of Tigger.

Developer should make sure that the external function uses the correct method to pass the return value, when MiniVM is running in either Eeyore mode or Tigger mode.

## Debugger of MiniVM

MiniVM does not have a built-in debugger, but it supports the `Break` instruction. When this instruction is executed, MiniVM will try to find and call an external function called `$debugger`.

Unlike the `Call`/`CallExt` instruction, there are no new environments will be created at this time. All internal states of MiniVM, such as the operand stack and the static registers, will be retained.

When `$debugger` returns, MiniVM will check the return value. If it's `False`, the execution process will be interrupted. Otherwise, MiniVM will ***re-execute*** the current instruction.
